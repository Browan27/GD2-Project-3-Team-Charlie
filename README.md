## GitConfig Instructions

* Create a new file called `.gitconfig` in your home directory. Example: `C:/Users/Kane/`
* Copy the text inside `SampleGitConfig.txt` inside `.gitconfig`
* Change lines 7 and 8 to match your current PC set up.
    - `C:/Program Files/Unity/Editor/Data/Tools/UnityYAMLMerge.exe` should be the location of that exe file
